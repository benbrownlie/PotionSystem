# SpellSystem
 
## About
SpellSystem is an experimental system used to create simple projectiles with unique effects attached to them.

## How to use
To test out a spell, drag the blueprint, Spell_BP, onto the screen.

Open the spell's inspector window. Here you will find the editable properties of the spell.

* Clicking on "Mesh" and navigating to Materials will allow you to change the material of the spell's base.
* Clicking on "SpellEffect" and checking under the particles tab will allow you to change the visual effect associated with the spell.

(Spell's come implemented with a movement system where they will fly in a straight line upon being spawned.)

The Demo will feature a few base particle effects and materials, however using your own is pretty simple. As previously mentioned, effects can be swapped out in the inspector window and replaced with one of your own design.

Pressing the "Spell" button in the demo will launch a projectile.
